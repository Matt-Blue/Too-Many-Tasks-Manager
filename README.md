## About TMTM

Too Many Tasks Manager is a simple task manager that incorporates the use of priorities to organize your To Do List.  It is a task manager application built on the Laravel PHP Framework using MySQL for database management.  User registration includes signup, signin and logout.  All cells are color coded, 5 - red | 4 - orange | 3 - yellow | 2 - green | 1 - blue | 0 - white.  Dates will be red - within 12 hours | orange - within one day | yellow - within three days | green - within five days | blue - within a week | white - outside one week.  Task Names will be color coded based on an average of the priority and date / time.  The simple table gives you access to sort by priority, task name and date & time.  It also allows easy deletion, incrementing and decrementing of priority and editing of task name and date / time.
